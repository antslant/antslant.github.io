            Hi, my name is Anthony Rigby. I'm a results-driven junior web
            developer with <span id="years-experience"></span> years of
            experience, specialising in start-ups and fast-paced environments.
            Successfully built an e-commerce business from a small budget to
            £500k in annual revenue, showcasing strong business acumen and
            problem-solving skills. Passionate about delivering high-quality
            solutions, I bring a detail-oriented and collaborative approach to
            both independent work and team projects.

        <h3>Mind Chart Health</h3>
        <h4>Software Engineer. Remote (UK)</h4>
        <p><time datetime="2022-12">December 2022</time> - Present</p>
        <p>
          Working as part of a two-person team under a senior engineer to
          develop a mental health data tracking and data aggregation platform.
          Work across both the front-end (React) and back-end (Express)
          codebases, developing components, APIs, database schemas and writing
          integration tests. Work independently with frequent code reviews.

        <h3>Thru Ai</h3>
        <h4>Front-End Software Engineer. Remote (San Francisco, US)</h4>
        <p>
          <time datetime="2024-01">January 2024</time> -
          <time datetime="2024-04">April 2024</time> (3-month contract)
        </p>
        <p>
          Helped develop a UI that allows users to leverage AI to build teams of
          bots to automate and build workflows. Took Figma designs and built
          feature-rich dashboards: filtering, search and drag and drop
          interaction. Enhanced existing UI by improving data load times
          (leveraging cache) and adding optimistic updates.

        <h4>Front-End Software Engineer. Remote (San Francisco, US)</h4>

          Worked within a team of 11 engineers using the Agile methodology to
          build and launch a telehealth application in the US. Responsible for
          building pixel-perfect UI using Next.js and Material UI. Built UI
          components, interacted with internal and third-party APIs and
          frequently deployed code to the production environment.

        <h3>GoGetTested</h3>
        <h4>Junior Front-End Software Engineer. Remote (San Francisco, US)</h4>
        <p>
          <time datetime="2021-01">January 2021</time> -

          Maintained and further developed an existing codebase for scheduling
          COVID-19 tests and managing COVID-19 vaccine status. The application
          was used to book 20,000+ COVID-19 tests per month. Although employed
          as a junior engineer as part of a two-person team, I ultimately became
          solely responsible for maintaining, developing and deploying the
          front-end codebase. Wrote end-to-end tests, built UI components and
          quickly deployed bug fixes using the Agile methodology.

          Started an online store retailing men's shaving and grooming products.
          Managed all aspects of the business: inventory, customer support,
          financial planning, accounts and staffing. Grew the business to a
          £500k (NET) yearly turnover with very little financial backing or
          marketing. Served customers worldwide and built a reputation for
          first-class customer service.
